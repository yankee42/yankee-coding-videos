00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Welcome back to "Let's build a compiler". 

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,330
In this episode we will

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,580
build in our language the minus, times and division operators.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,890
My name is Yankee and I hope you have a lot of fun.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,850
Initially, we will specify our compiler,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,460
which will as well be known by the name "CompilerTest".

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,640
Then we'll go to our examples, that we want to be able to

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,600
copy one line as sample

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,110
and put down here some examples.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,710
In fact: What will we build?

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,210
Firstly, we'll have a subtraction,

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,390
taking "3-2" for example,

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,960
then we will have an 1 as output.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,320
Then we might as well build multiplication,

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,550
taking "2+3", so that we need "6" as output.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:59,920
then Division, namely "6/2" as example of it,

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,940
so comes 3 as output.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,600
Then, we can think later

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,720
on what happens if no result returns as output,

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,050
also, what should happened with "7/2"?

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,320
Typically, when we deal with integers

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,100
we cut the ".5" from behind,

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,080
Until this moment, we've worked only with integers,

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,030
later we naturally will have floating point types

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,970
but for the beginning we still with what we have

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,650
and the result stays 3, without the 0.5 behind.

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,140
Then one could naturally combine the operators:

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,840
For example, if we have: "8-2+5",

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,750
is really important to calculate first the "8-2" (making 6)

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,380
and thereafter "+5", so we'll have 11.

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,980
In place of "2+5", which would be 7 

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,130
and so does "8-7", which would be 1.

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:06,250
The same happening to division, were we could take "8/2*4" as example.

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,300
"8/2" are 4, times 4 makes 16.

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,860
Here again, another thing outcomes,

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,780
if we calculate first the '2*4", it would be 8

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,010
and then we would have "8/8, naturally 1.

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,350
Then we can also combine subtraction with the multiplication:

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,140
We can take for example "2+3*3",

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,520
we should first calculate "3*3" (being 9), "+2" being 11, 

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,760
if we would first calculate "2+3", then would be 5, times 3 would be 15,

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,170
that's another thing again.

43
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,660
and the same, once again, with the subtraction:

44
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,070
Like in the example "9-2*3":

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,150
"2*3" are 6 and "9-6" are 3.

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:09,570
In reverse, "9-2" would be 7, times 3 would be 21.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,780
Then we save this and go forward...

48
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,380
Ah, for the first time we will see if our test has fails already.

49
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,220
Yes, we have many "Failures" here, 7 Failures,

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,290
these all are our new tests

51
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,770
and here at the top we have many "Token recognition error"s,

52
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,170
because ANTLR still not recognize all these operators over here.

53
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,660
So now we go next to our grammar

54
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,220
and we will continue with our new operators.

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,440
At first, we rename now some things in our grammar.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,110
Because our "addition" rule will either way be expanded,

57
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,340
to make it contain not only additions,

58
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,090
but any math expression,

59
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,020
for this I call the "expression" rule

60
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,730
and then I will be using default English terms here,

61
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,520
because at the moment there is an incompatibility between German and English writing

62
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,980
and this is not good.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,510
Otherwise, I like the idea where 

64
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,000
with this number translate to the English

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,890
e is very unpractical, if there are too much German terms.

66
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,010
After we have this done...

67
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,400
After we have this done again

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,110
in our usual known way

69
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,520
I build our parser again,

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,900
pressing "F5" on parser,

71
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,720
then we go to the visitor

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,080
and adapt our terms,

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,050
this thing here is called naturally "right" now,

74
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:03,080
"ZahlContext" doesn't work anymore, now we name it "NumberContext"

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,910
with "Ctrl+Shift+0" we can fix the importations,

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,610
and we save again and we'll see later,

77
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,000
if our tests still correct or working badly like just before.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,540
Yes, our first three tests are working

79
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,670
and the news, those, that we generated just now, aren't working.

80
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,710
We go back to our grammar

81
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,400
and start now with the improvements.

82
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,520
At first, we will build our "minus" operator.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,850
We'll gona by here also copy our previous "plus" rule

84
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,340
and put an alternative for the "minus".

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,770
We call this "Minus",

86
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,940
we change the operator to "minus" here,

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,300
we save, we return again to the console,

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,970
we leave our parser generate anew,

89
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,250
go to the parser, press "F5",

90
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,030
we go over the visitor, behind the visitPlus

91
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,040
now we can insert a new "visitMinus" method,

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,350
it works similarly to "visitPlus",

93
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,350
Now, here I simply copy the template,

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,760
for the subtraction we only in place of "iadd" we name it "isub".

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,410
Wonderful, we close it and leave the test run once more.

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,290
What's the result?

97
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,940
In our minus test the "println(3-2) worked!

98
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,820
Hey! That was simple!

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,760
We want to see once again if it will be right together with the other operators.

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,300
So we copy again our previous rule too,

101
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,070
again for the division and multiplication,

102
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,320
our parser must be generated again with the old known command,

103
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,480
let's go to the parser with "F5",

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,520
we go to our visitor

105
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,950
and will implement the new "visit" method.

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,230
For division

107
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,070
The same again what we have had with minus,

108
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,890
just with "idiv" standing for i-divide

109
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,210
and then again another for multiplication

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,280
and we call the instructions "imul".

111
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,350
We save, leave our tests run

112
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,380
and what do we see here?

113
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,510
Eight of our tests worked, two doesn't.

114
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,000
Times worked, division worked,

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,340
that with the "7/2" also worked,

116
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,520
"8/2*4" worked too,

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,600
but, unfortunately these two didn't work.

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,750
And as you can see here: we have 11 waiting, but 15 retrieved,

119
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,340
obviously, the operator order was not properly observed here,

120
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,210
here it would have to calculate "2+3" first, making 5

121
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,720
and then times 3, making 15, and it's what we received here.

122
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,970
but, sadly, this is not what we wanted.

123
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,670
At this local it gives us a little Cliffhanger.

124
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,400
How we manage correctly the operators priorities,

125
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,570
so that our two remaining tests would work you will learn in the next episode.

126
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,090
In this episode we learned how to build minus

127
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,230
division and plus operators in the grammar

128
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,700
and how we generate combined instructions:

129
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,350
Further operators with sub-rules definitions

130
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,520
and combined instructions generation with new visit methods,

131
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,660
looks almost exactly like "visitPlus" method.

132
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,250
On our next episode we're expecting, as mentioned

133
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,730
the right order definition for the operators

134
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,910
and we expect later

135
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,790
variables, loops, conditional functions and much more.

136
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,920
Write me in the comments, for what you want for the next episodes.

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
Naturally, I would be flattered with comment replies:

138
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,950
What are the pluses and the minuses?

139
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,950
How do you take advantage of the videos?

140
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,470
Do you program along?

141
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,440
You use the videos for research about concrete problems?

142
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,050
Or do you watch the videos without any project, just for interest?

143
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,730
Thanks a lot to Gadarol, that permitted to record in his studio

144
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,200
and thank you very much for paying attention.

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,570
My name is Yankee, I hope you've had fun,

146
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,420
goodbye and see you later

147
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,520
for another: "Let's build a compiler".
